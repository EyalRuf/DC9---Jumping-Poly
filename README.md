# Eyal's DC9 project

You’ll need to follow a few steps before you can run my phaser game.

## 1. Clone or download this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/EyalRuf/DC9---Jumping-Poly.git```


## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser
